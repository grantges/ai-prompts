    },
    {
      "title": "Survey Design",

      "title": "Synthesis & Theming",

      "title": "Journey Mapping",
      "prompt": "As a Senior UX Researcher, help me create a user journey map for {{persona}} performing {{task}}. Break it down into stages, touchpoints, emotions, pain points, and opportunities. Summarize the top 3 insights and actionable recommendations for the product team."
